I am Krisztian Imre, specializing in AI and machine learning with a solid background in business communications and digital health innovation. As the Head of Innovation and co-founder of EVA Vision Research and Development, I led the development of award-winning AI-driven smart glasses, supported by the EU’s Horizon2020 SME Instruments. I also consulted and managed digital health research project named 'SAVE' for EUs Active and Assisted Living Programme across Hungary, Romania, and Italy.

My skills encompass designing and statistically evaluating behavioral and cognitive experiments, written communication, intellectual property, and brand development, with extensive experience in managing interdisciplinary projects. I am currently pursuing MSc degrees in Human-Centered AI and Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Additionally, I hold a BA in Business Communications and an AA in Typography Design.
